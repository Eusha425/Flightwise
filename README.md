# FlightWise: AI-Powered Airline Intelligence Platform

FlightWise is a sophisticated web application that leverages the power of generative AI to provide users with deep insights into the world of air travel. It offers a suite of tools for analyzing flight routes, comparing airlines, tracking price histories, and determining the best time to book flights.

## Features

FlightWise is built around a collection of intelligent tools designed to empower travelers and analysts:

-   **Dynamic Dashboard:** Get a high-level overview with key performance indicators (KPIs) like total routes analyzed, price predictions made, and airport connectivity stats. These metrics are dynamically generated by AI on each page load to simulate a real-time analytics environment.
-   **Best Time to Book Recommender:** Enter a flight route and a desired departure date, and our AI will analyze historical trends and seasonality to recommend the optimal time to purchase your tickets for the best price.
-   **Interactive Route Explorer:** Discover every direct flight destination from any airport in the world. Just enter an IATA code, and the application will display the routes on an interactive global map, with all data sourced dynamically from our AI model.
-   **Airline Comparison Tool:** Make informed decisions by comparing airlines on a specific route. The tool provides a detailed breakdown of airlines based on customer ratings, in-flight amenities, typical flight duration, and estimated price.
-   **Price History Visualization:** Visualize the price fluctuations for any flight route over the last 90 days. The AI generates a plausible historical price chart, helping you understand pricing trends and seasonality.
